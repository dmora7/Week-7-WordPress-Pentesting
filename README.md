  - [x] Steps to recreate: First, you will need to create a user account with 'Contributor' or 'Editor' level privileges. Once created, log in to that account and copy and paste `<a href="[caption code=">]</a><a title=" onmouseover=alert('test')  ">link</a>` to a new post. Publish the post and now on a different browser, log in as the administrator. Navigate to the page or post where the line of code was placed and a pop up displaying `test` will appear. Thus, you have successfully recreated this exploit.
